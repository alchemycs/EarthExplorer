[EarthExplorer.info] was first concieved one weekend while talking with my 
(then 10yo) son about geography. We were talking about how different 
geographical descriptions are like containers and can be neighboured or 
even overlap.

I figured the best way for him to get his head around it was to explore the 
world for himself. At the time I had a bit of interest in the [Yahoo! GeoPlanet].
data so I set to creating [EarthExplorer.info].

The total code base took about a day all up including looking around for a 
decent template. It's a bit rough, but I wanted to get it out there.

I'm certainly interested in hearing any suggestions or receiving patches/updates.

So Where's The Code?
--------------------
Currently I'm in the process of cleaning up the code for [EarthExplorer.info] so I can
put it on [GitHub]. Mainly adding a little documentation and cleaning out 
private data.

It's based on the [Agavi Professional PHP Framework][agavi] like most of my 
projects. If you are not familiar with it I can't recommend it high enough. Go
check it out, you can thank me later :)
