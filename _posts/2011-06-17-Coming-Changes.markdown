Map Technology
==============
For some time I've been thinking about changing the maps from [Yahoo!][ymaps] to 
[Google][gmaps], but with [Yahoo!s recent announcement][nomaps] that they are 
[closing their maps API][nomaps] it's definitely time to get onto it!

Agavi Framework
===============
The Agavi Framework has just had it's [stable release bumped up to 1.0.5](http://blog.agavi.org/post/6597768729/agavi-1-0-5-released)
...now if only I could get some movement on my day job to bring the hosting os 
and php stack to support anything beyond 0.11.8 I'll be happy!
