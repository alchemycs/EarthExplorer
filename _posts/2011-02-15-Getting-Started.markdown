##Getting Started
I'm in the process of cleaning up the code for [EarthExplorer.info] so I can
put it on [GitHub]. Mainly adding a little documentation and cleaning out 
private data.

It's based on the [Agavi Professional PHP Framework][agavi] like most of my 
projects. If you are not familiar with it I can't recommend it high enough. Go
check it out, you can thank me later :)
