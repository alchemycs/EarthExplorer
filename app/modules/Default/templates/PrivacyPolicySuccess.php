    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    	It is <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a>'s 
    	policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect 
    	while operating our websites.
    </p>
    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
        Like most website operators, <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">
        EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> collects non-personally-identifying information 
        of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, 
        such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the 
        date and time of each visitor request. 
        <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a>'s 
        purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to 
        better understand how <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">
        EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a>'s visitors use its website. From time to time, 
        <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> may 
        release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, 
        e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> also 
        collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet 
        Protocol (IP) addresses. <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">
        EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> does not use such information to identify its 
        visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than 
        under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses 
        personally-identifying information, as described below.
    </p>
    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>

        <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> in ways 
        that require <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">

        The amount and type of information that 
        <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> gathers 
        depends on the nature of the interaction. 
<!--
        For example, we ask visitors who <a href="PERFORM AN ACTION">PERFORM AN ACTION</a> at <a href="http://www.&lt;a href=" your="" site"="">YOUR SITE</a>/"&gt;<a href="YOUR SITE">YOUR SITE</a> to provide <a href="CERTAIN DETAILS">CERTAIN DETAILS</a>.

-->
		In each case, <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">
		EARTHEXPLORER.INFO</a> collects such information only insofar as is 
		necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's 
		interaction with <a href="<?php echo $ro->gen('Home');?>">
